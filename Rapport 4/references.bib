	abstract = {{sRGB} (standard Red Green Blue) is an {RGB} color space that {HP} and Microsoft created cooperatively in 1996 to use on monitors, printers, and the Internet. It was subsequently standardized by the {IEC} as {IEC} 61966-2-1:1999. It is often the "default" color space for images that contain no color space information, especially if the images' pixels are stored in 8-bit integers per color channel.
{sRGB} uses the {ITU}-R {BT}.709 primaries, the same as in studio monitors and {HDTV}, a transfer function (gamma curve) typical of {CRTs}, and a viewing environment designed to match typical home and office viewing conditions. This specification allowed {sRGB} to be directly displayed on typical {CRT} monitors of the time, which greatly aided its acceptance.},
